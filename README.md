Individual final project for **Artificial Intelligence — Basic Level B2**.

AutoWorth AI estimates the fair market price of a used car from the 100,000 UK Used Car Dataset, then compares that estimate with the seller's asking price and returns an actionable deal rating.

## What the system answers

> **"What is the expected market price of this car, and is the seller offering a good deal?"**

**Example:**
* **Estimated market price:** £10,697
* **Seller price:** £9,200
* **Difference:** £1,497 cheaper
* **Deal rating:** Great Deal

## Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle [100,000 UK Used Car Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes)
* **Manufacturer files used for modelling:** Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes, Skoda, Toyota, Vauxhall, Volkswagen (97,050 clean listings).
* *Note:* `cclass.csv`, `focus.csv`, and unclean files are excluded as they lack tax/mpg data or contain unstandardized duplicates.

## Project Pipeline

1. **Data Integration:** Load individual brand CSVs and assign the `make` feature.
2. **Cleaning & Sanity Checks:** Remove duplicates, anomalous years (e.g., 2060, pre-1995), engine size 0.0 entries, and cap unrealistic MPG (>120).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Price distribution, mileage decay, brand tiering, and boxplots across transmission types.
4. **Leakage Prevention:** 70% / 15% / 15% Train/Val/Test strict split before any transformations.
5. **Feature Engineering:**
   * `car_age`: 2020 − year
   * `mileage_per_year`: mileage ÷ max(car_age, 1)
   * `is_premium`: German premium brand flag (Audi, BMW, Mercedes)
   * `engine_efficiency`: mpg ÷ engineSize
6. **Model Benchmarking:** Train Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RandomizedSearchCV on XGBoost parameters (`learning_rate`, `max_depth`, `n_estimators`, `colsample_bytree`).
8. **Final Evaluation:** Evaluate the tuned XGBoost on the unbiased held-out test set.
9. **Explainability & Diagnostics:** Feature importances and residual/error diagnostics.
10. **Productization:** Interactive Streamlit web interface with real-time deal evaluation.

## Deal Ratings

| Rating | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🟢 **Great Deal** | Seller is > 10% cheaper than predicted market price |
| 🔵 **Good Deal** | 5% to 10% cheaper |
| ⚪ **Fair Price** | Within ±5% |
| 🟠 **Slightly Overpriced** | 5% to 10% more expensive |
| 🔴 **Overpriced** | More than 10% above predicted market price |

## Results from the Trained Pipeline

Performance metrics for the final **Tuned XGBoost** model on the held-out test set:

| Split | $R^2$ | MAE (£) | RMSE (£) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Validation (Tuned)** | 0.967 | £1,083.00 | £1,654.00 |
| **Test Set (Held-Out)** | **0.968** | **£1,070.86** | **£1,654.05** |

*Tuning improved XGBoost validation $R^2$ from 0.954 to 0.967. The test set performance confirmed strong generalization with zero data leakage.*
